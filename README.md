# What is this?
This is a collection of files to set up a cool environment. It includes tmux, LazyNvim, and a bashrc file currently.

I modified LazyNvim slightly: I used the supertab recipe to make tab autocomplete work more like VSCode, and added a plugin for indenting scope (mini.nvim).

# Requirements
- stow
- tmux
- nvim

# Use
- Download requirements
- Clone the git repo (I like the gh cli)
- Use stow *foldername* to link the config files in the right place
